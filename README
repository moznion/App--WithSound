NAME
    with-sound - Command executor with sound

VERSION
    This document describes with-sound version 1.1.0

SYNOPSIS
        $ with-sound [command] ([argument(s)])

        # e.g.
        #    $ with-sound prove t/

DESCRIPTION
    with-sound is the command executor with sound (now with-sound can play
    the MP3 file only).

    If exit-status of the command is success, it playbacks the sound of
    success. Else, it plays sound of failure. And this application also can play the sound during executing the command.

CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT
    App::WithSound requires a resource file as '.with-soundrc' on your home
    directory. This resource file specifies the path to sound files. Like
    so:

        SUCCESS=~/Music/success.mp3
        FAILURE=~/Music/failure.mp3
        RUNNING=~/Music/running.mp3

    If you want to play a different sound for each command, you set using block. Like so:

        [prove]
        SUCCESS=~/Music/success_prove.mp3
        FAILURE=~/Music/failure_prove.mp3
        RUNNING=~/Music/running_prove.mp3

    When you execute 'prove' command, this setting is used.

    You also can specify the paths by environment variables $ENV{'WITH_SOUND_SUCCESS'}, $ENV{'WITH_SOUND_FAILURE'}
    and $ENV{'WITH_SOUND_RUNNING'}.

    If the file paths are set by both environment variables and a
    configuration file, the environment variables are prior to the
    configuration file.

    These sound file settings are optional. You do not have to fill the all of settings.
    with-sound will ignore playing sound if the sound file is not specified.

    This module also requires "mpg123" or "mpg321" or "afplay" so please install it before use this
